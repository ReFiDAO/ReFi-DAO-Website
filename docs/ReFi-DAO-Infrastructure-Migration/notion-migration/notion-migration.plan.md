- **Ghost Migration:** No direct dependency
- **Airtable Migration:** Phase 2 may involve migrating appropriate Airtable data to Notion

### Key Integration Points

- Resources Hub accessible from website
- Project workspaces available to local nodes
- Unified workspace improves collaboration
- Potential website integration in future

## Cost Impact

### Current Cost
- Notion: $0 (free tier)

### New Cost
- Notion: $0 (free tier)

### Savings
- No cost change, but improved organization
