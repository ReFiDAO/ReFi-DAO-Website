# Community

Welcome to the ReFi DAO Community - the home of the regenerative-finance ecosystem and a "network state for people & planet".

ReFi DAO brings together regenerative finance communities, builders, and practitioners from around the world. Whether you're interested in starting a local node, joining a guild, or participating in working groups, there's a place for you in our network.

## Local Nodes
