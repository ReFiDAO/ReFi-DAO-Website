# Federated Node Structure

ReFi DAO uses a federated approach where each local node maintains its own repository and website.

## Benefits

- **Local Autonomy** - Each node controls its own content
- **Customization** - Nodes can customize their site to match local needs
- **Community Ownership** - Content is owned by the local community
- **Easy Contribution** - Community members can contribute via pull requests

## Fork the Template

Each local node can fork the main ReFi DAO website template to create their own site.

> **Template Repository:** Coming soon

## Structure

- Main site links to all federated nodes
- Each node maintains its own GitHub repository
- Nodes can customize while maintaining ReFi DAO branding
- Pull request workflow enables easy contributions

## Get Started

1. Fork the template repository
2. Customize for your local community
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages
4. Submit a PR to add your node to the main site
