# Host a Celo Activation Station

## **Overview**

An activation station is a physical booth where you can get people to take a specific action for publicly-verifiable impact. You could activate a community towards any behaviour such as Planting a tree, Donating to charity, or Onboarding onto a specific tech platform such as Gitcoin. For this guide, think about a Celo ecosystem-related activation such as setting up a Celo Wallet, investing on EthicHub, or getting a Celo Prosperity Passport.

## Instructions: **Hosting a Celo Activation Station**

Hosting a Celo Activation Station is a powerful way to engage your community and drive specific behaviors or actions that align with the Celo ecosystem's values and goals. To get started, follow these steps, customized to the Celo ecosystem:

### 1. Review the 'How to Host an Activation Station Guide'
