# How to run successful Twitter Spaces to increase following

Twitter Spaces are a great feature to engage with your audience and increase reach. It is a great opportunity for Local Nodes to come together and leverage the power of shared promotion efforts. This guide will walk you through how to successfully run Twitter Spaces, with tips on preparation, hosting, and engagement.

### Preparation

1. **Choose a Topic:** Before starting a Space, it's important to choose a topic that you're passionate about and that will interest your audience. This could be anything from a recent news or event, for people to get to know you better, or a topic of interest for the wide community.
2. **Plan Your Space:** Think about what you want to achieve with your Space. Is it to share knowledge, create a networking opportunity, promote something specific, or just to chat? Once you know what your goal is, you can plan the structure of your Space, how long it will last, and what you'll talk about.
3. **Schedule and Announce Your Space:** Scheduling your Space in advance allows your followers to plan ahead. Twitter allows you to schedule Spaces up to 14 days in advance. Once you've scheduled your Space, don't forget to promote it to your followers and invite them to join.

### Hosting

1. **Manage Speakers:** As a host, you control who can speak in your Space. You can invite specific people to join as speakers, or you can let attendees request to speak. Be aware that too many speakers can make a Space chaotic, so it's often best to keep the number of speakers limited.
2. **Use Captions:** Twitter Spaces supports live captions, which can make your Space more accessible. Make sure you turn this feature on.

### Inviting Influencers

Inviting influencers from your ecosystem to your Twitter Space can significantly boost its success. Influencers already have established, engaged audiences who trust them and their content. Leveraging this can help grow your own audience. Here's how to effectively include influencers in your Twitter Spaces:

1. **Identify Relevant Influencers:** Find influencers who align with the topic of your Space. They should be individuals who have expertise or a strong interest in the topic and are known for engaging effectively with their audience.
2. **Invite Them to Speak:** Reach out to influencers and invite them to participate as speakers in your Space. Provide them with clear information about the topic, format, date and time of the Space. Highlight why you believe they would be a great fit and the value they can add to the discussion.
3. **Promote Their Participation:** Once an influencer has agreed to participate, promote this on your Twitter and other social media accounts. This can increase the interest of both your followers and the influencer's followers, attracting a larger audience to your Space.
4. **Appreciate Their Contribution:** After the Space, publicly thank all the speakers for their contribution. This can strengthen your relationship with them and increase the chances of them participating in future Spaces or promoting your Spaces to their audience.

### Engagement

1. **Engage with Your Audience:** Engaging with your audience is key to a successful Space. Ask questions, respond to comments, and make your Space a two-way conversation. This will keep your audience engaged and make them more likely to return for future Spaces.
2. **Utilize Reactions:** Twitter Spaces has a range of reactions that hosts and participants can use to communicate non-verbally. Encourage your participants to use these reactions to show their agreement, amusement, or other feelings.
3. **Summarize and Recap:** Throughout your Space, make sure you're regularly summarizing the conversation and recapping key points. This can be especially useful for people who join the Space partway through.

### After the Space

1. **Follow up:** After your Space ends, keep the conversation going. You could post a summary of the discussion, ask for feedback, or start planning your next Space.
2. **Evaluate:** Consider what went well and what didn't. What could you do differently next time to make your Space even better? This reflection will help you continually improve your Twitter Spaces.

Remember, like any other social platform, running successful Twitter Spaces takes practice. It's about engaging with your audience and providing value, whether that's in the form of interesting discussions, expert insights, or simply a space for people to connect and chat. With planning and practice, you can become a successful Twitter Spaces host.
