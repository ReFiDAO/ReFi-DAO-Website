See the “Local Nodes Alpha Cohort June 22” section for more inspiration from the different local nodes. A Summary of the sticky notes is also below. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this workshop is to create clarity on what the revenue and income model is for your local node. As an outcome of this workshop, you will have created clarity on:

- Which local node activities need to be funded?
- What is your funding hypothesis?
- What types of funding are potentially available?
- Which specific funding sources could you pursue?

Note: it is beyond the scope of this exercise is to determine resource and team requirements in order to fulfill your funding hypothesis, as well as to assign specific tasks to specific people and create accountability. Separate guides for these topics will need to be created!
