# How to use Tonglen Meditation to Open Your Event

## Introduction

Tonglen meditation is an ancient practice originating from Tibetan Buddhism, designed to cultivate compassion and empathy towards oneself and others. It involves a powerful process of breathing in the suffering or negativity (often visualized as a thick, black smoke) and breathing out relief, positivity, and compassion. 

This transformative practice can be used in various settings, including personal meditation or group activities. In fact, it's an excellent way to begin a live event, as it fosters a sense of unity, empathy, and shared purpose among participants, setting a positive and mindful tone for the proceedings.

The following is a sample script with annotations for the speaker, for a meditation that would take about 5 minutes. 

## Script

*[Begin with a calm, gentle tone. Speak slowly and clearly, allowing each word to resonate in the room. Pause for 3 seconds between each sentence to let the words sink in.]*

"Dear friends, let us gather our hearts and minds for the practice of Tonglen, the ancient Tibetan Buddhist practice of giving and receiving. This is a practice of compassion, of opening our hearts to the suffering of others and ourselves. Let us begin."

*[Pause for 5 seconds. Lower your voice slightly, creating an atmosphere of introspection.]*

"First, find a comfortable position. You may sit or lay down, whatever feels most comfortable for you. Close your eyes and take a moment to settle into your body. Feel the weight of your body on the chair or floor, and let any tension melt away."

*[Pause for 10 seconds. Maintain a soft, soothing tone.]*

"Now, bring your attention to your breath. Notice the sensation of the breath as it enters and leaves your body. There is no need to change your breath, simply notice it. It is the anchor of our practice."

*[Pause for 20 seconds. Speak in a whisper, encouraging deeper focus.]*

"Visualize your breath as a thick, black, sticky tar or smoke. As you breathe in, imagine you are breathing in this tar, representing your own pain, suffering, and negativity. Take it into your heart."

*[Pause for 10 seconds. Raise your voice slightly, instilling a sense of courage and strength.]*

"As you breathe out, imagine you are breathing out cool, light air. This represents relief, joy, and positivity. Breathe out all the love, compassion, and healing you have to offer, sending it out into the world."

*[Pause for 10 seconds. Maintain a steady, rhythmic pace, mirroring the rhythm of breath.]*

"Now, extend your focus to your friends and family. Breathe in their pain and suffering as black tar, and breathe out relief and compassion."

*[Pause for 20 seconds. Continue with a steady, rhythmic pace.]*

"Next, extend your focus to your community and nation. Breathe in their collective pain and suffering as black tar, and breathe out relief and compassion."

*[Pause for 20 seconds. Continue with a steady, rhythmic pace.]*

"Finally, extend your focus to the entire world, including the earth, the oceans, the plants and animals. Breathe in the pain and suffering of all beings as black tar, and breathe out relief and compassion."

*[Pause for 1 minute. Speak in a normal volume, signaling the end of the practice.]*

"Now, gently bring your attention back to your body. Notice the sensation of your body on the chair or floor. When you are ready, slowly open your eyes."

*[Pause for 10 seconds. End with a gentle, compassionate tone.]*

"Thank you for your practice today. May the compassion we cultivated today benefit all beings."

*[End with a moment of silence, allowing the energy of the practice to settle.]*
