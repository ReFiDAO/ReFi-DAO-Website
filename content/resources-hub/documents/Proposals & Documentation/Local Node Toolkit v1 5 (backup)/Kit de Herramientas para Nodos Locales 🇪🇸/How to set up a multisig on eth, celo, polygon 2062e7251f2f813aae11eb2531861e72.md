# How to Set Up a Multisig on Eth, Celo, Polygon

A multisig is a type of wallet that requires multiple signatures or approvals before any transaction can be executed. This is a great way to enhance security and reduce the risk of loss or theft. In this guide, we will show you how to set up a multisig wallet on three popular blockchain networks: Ethereum (Eth), Celo, and Polygon.

## How to Create an Individual Wallet on Ethereum

1. Choose a wallet provider that supports Ethereum. Some popular options include MetaMask, MyEtherWallet, and Exodus.
2. Create a new wallet by following the prompts provided by your chosen wallet provider. This will typically involve choosing a username and password, and may require you to generate a seed phrase to use as a backup.
3. Once your wallet is created, you will be provided with an Ethereum address. This is a unique identifier that you can use to send and receive Ethereum.
4. Make note of your Ethereum address and keep it in a safe place. You will need to provide this address whenever you want to receive Ethereum from someone else.
5. To send Ethereum from your wallet, you will need to enter the recipient's Ethereum address and the amount you wish to send. Be sure to double-check the address before sending any funds, as transactions on the Ethereum network are irreversible.
