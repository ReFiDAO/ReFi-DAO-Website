# Hypercert Minting Guide | ReFi Local Nodes

### Table of Contents

# **Introduction**

This guide is intended to **provide you with a comprehensive overview of hypercerts, their significance for ReFi DAO, and step-by-step instructions for minting them.** We aim to make this process as straightforward and informative as possible, enabling you to effectively showcase your node's impact.

For ReFi Local Nodes, effective use of hypercerts can build:

- A transparent and permanent on-chain record of all of the work and associated impacts the Local Node has been involved in.
- Trust, credibility and reputation when seeking to raise funding from Web3 grant providers (Gitcoin, Celo & Optimism RPGF etc‚Ä¶)
- Potential eligibility for a ReFi DAO RPGF funding round üëÄ

Follow this guide to learn more and implement üëá

# Background

## **What are Hypercerts?**

Hypercerts are a novel token standard designed to transparently track and reward positive impact. Each hypercert represents a unique impact claim, encapsulating the scope of work, the timeframe, the contributors, and the rights conferred by ownership. Implemented as ERC-1155 semi-fungible tokens, hypercerts are stored on IPFS, ensuring durability and accessibility of the impact information.

## **Why Hypercerts Matter**

Hypercerts have the potential to address a critical gap in the funding and recognition of public goods by enabling a scalable, distributed, and transparent impact-tracking system. This system can not only track but also evaluate and reward impactful work, providing a powerful incentive for creators and funders alike. The versatility of hypercerts supports diverse funding mechanisms and facilitates experimentation and interoperability, enhancing the efficiency of impact capital allocation.

## ReFi DAO Vision

We envision hypercerts as a key primitive for tracking activities across the global network of ReFi Local Nodes and helping to channel resources towards those with the highest verifiable impact. For each local node, the minting of hypercerts will create a transparent record of impacts that will serve to bolster reputation and fundraising potential. In practice, this means:

- All active ReFi Local Nodes should mint hypercerts for all the impact actions they have done since funds were raised.
- ReFi DAO Sponsors can receive a share of the hypercerts and thus have an on-chain claim to the impact they helped support with their sponsorship.
- Retroactive funding for the most impressive and credible impact claims.

# **Minting Guidelines - Preparing Your Hypercerts**

<aside>
‚ùó Please read and follow the below guidelines carefully!

</aside>

When minting a hypercert for your project using the [hypercert minting dApp](https://hypercerts.org/app/create/), you must provide information across several fields. See below for the specific fields you must complete and how ReFi DAO recommends you fill in the information.

**Instructions**: choose below for the type of work completed that you would like to report, read the guidance thoroughly, and start minting! NOTE: Ideally you mint the hypercert in a wallet that has been set up specifically for your local node (you can create one in Metamask in a couple of clicks), otherwise a local node founder‚Äôs wallet is also ok. 

## 1. Node Incubation

**Overview**: Mint a hypercert to document the founding date / period of the local node. This date could be the node‚Äôs participation in a ReFi DAO incubator program, its first Gitcoin grant, or any other meaningful date signifying the beginning of the node.

- **Example Hypercert by ReFi London ‚Üí [view here](https://hypercerts.org/app/view#claimId=0x16ba53b74c234c870c61efc04cd418b8f2865959-5444517870735015415413993718908291383296)**

### a. General Fields

- **Hypercert Name**: Combine your node name with the event name as follows: *<node name>* | Incubation üå± **(e.g. "ReFi London | Incubation üå±").
- **Logo Image**: Copy-paste the URI of an image for the top left part of the card. This could be your node logo. You should see a preview of the icon in the artwork. Square-shaped PNG/JPG format is best. TIP: You can copy the image URL from your Twitter profile picture or other social media account (right-click on the image and select ‚Äòcopy image address‚Äô) or upload new images to a service such as [Postimages.org](http://postimages.org/).
- **Background Banner Image**: Copy-paste a URI for a background banner image that will extend across the upper half of the artwork. This could be your project masthead or a unique piece of art. You will see a preview of the icon in the artwork. Note: it should have an aspect ratio of 1.5 (width to height) and be at least 320 pixels wide and 214 pixels high.
- **Description**: A human-readable description of your node and its formative moment / incubation. Utilize Markdown for formatting and include links for additional information. Stick to about 500 characters.
- **Link**: e.g. your Local Node Twitter account, website or Linktree.

### b. Hypercert Fields

- **Work Scope**: Copy and paste these tags: ReFi DAO Local Node, Incubation
- **Work Start/End Dates**: Specify the timeframe represented by the hypercert. This date could be the node‚Äôs participation in a ReFi DAO incubator program, its first Gitcoin grant, or any other meaningful date signifying the beginning of the node.
- **List of Contributors**: Include all key founding contributors, one per line or comma-separated. The list should include all key contributors involved in the work. Contributors are ideally wallet addresses or ENS names, but can also be names / pseudonyms. Groups of contributors can be represented by a multisig or name of an organization. Note - *All contributors' addresses, names or pseudonyms will be public.*

### **c. Allow List & Distribution**

The **allow list** allows you to distribute ownership of your Hypercert between multiple addresses. This allows other parties to be able to claim fractions of the hypercert (e.g. project funders or partners).

<aside>
‚ùó Make sure refidao.eth - 0x7340F1a1e4e38F43d2FCC85cdb2b764de36B40c0 - is listed in the allow list. See below for guidance.

</aside>

### **Simple allow List Guidance - Adding ReFi DAO Global** (refidao.eth)

Following these two steps will create an equal share distribution of the hypercert between ReFi DAO Global (refidao.eth) and the wallet you are minting from.

1. Paste the following link into ‚ÄòAllow List‚Äô field: [https://bafybeiaxqfx5hd2ehpftixxcrtjgkmxyu54ielb6ch62fqwfayamf34uyy.ipfs.w3s.link/ipfs/bafybeiaxqfx5hd2ehpftixxcrtjgkmxyu54ielb6ch62fqwfayamf34uyy/refi-dao-local-nodes-hypercert-allowlist1.csv](https://bafybeiaxqfx5hd2ehpftixxcrtjgkmxyu54ielb6ch62fqwfayamf34uyy.ipfs.w3s.link/ipfs/bafybeiaxqfx5hd2ehpftixxcrtjgkmxyu54ielb6ch62fqwfayamf34uyy/refi-dao-local-nodes-hypercert-allowlist1.csv)
2. Select a ‚ÄòPercentage distributed via allowlist‚Äô of 50%.

NOTE: At this stage, this split is more notional rather than defining an equity-like share. The main point is that at least some proportion of the hypercerts does go to ReFi DAO Global to create an on-chain link to the work!

## 2. Events

**Overview**: Mint hypercerts to document every event that your local node has organised, sponsored or supported in any meaningful way.

- **Single Event** - Mint one hypercert per event.
- **Event Series** - Mint one hypercert for a series of events over a defined period. e.g. all Twitter spaces the node has hosted or all of the weekly community meetups etc‚Ä¶
- **Example Hypercert by ReFi London ‚Üí [view here](https://hypercerts.org/app/view#claimId=0x16ba53b74c234c870c61efc04cd418b8f2865959-4763953136893138488487244504044754960384)**
