# Introduction

### üìç¬†What is a ReFi Local Node?

A ReFi Local Node is a **place-based community** that serves as a living laboratory for regenerative finance in your region. As described in [ReFi DAO Network - Structure, Roles, & Governance](ReFi%20DAO%20Network%20-%20Structure,%20Roles,%20&%20Governance%202062e7251f2f80219df3d996d1a95ea1.md), ReFi Local Nodes:

- **Build local regenerative economies** through events, media, software, capital raising, and land projects.
- **Experiment with and implement** ReFi tools and systems, see [Local ReFi Toolkit (Drafting)](https://www.notion.so/Local-ReFi-Toolkit-Drafting-1ba2e7251f2f808d95b9f6d9f21cf77c?pvs=21).
- **Operate with regional autonomy** while maintaining alignment with ReFi DAO's global vision, mission and values, see [ReFi DAO Community Covenant V1](ReFi%20DAO%20Community%20Covenant%20V1%202072e7251f2f801bafbcc06b48debc70.md) .
- **Share knowledge and learnings** with the broader network to accelerate collective impact.
    - [Local Node Toolkit v1.5](https://www.notion.so/Local-Node-Toolkit-v1-5-2252e7251f2f8067bdaec75fea036d3c?pvs=21)

### ü™∑¬†Core Principles of the Network

As you embark on this journey, remember that ReFi DAO operates on principles of:

- **Decentralized Autonomy with Collaborative Alignment** - You'll have the freedom to shape your Local Node according to your region's unique needs while staying connected to our global mission.
- **Mutual Reciprocity** - Our network thrives when value flows in both directions ‚Äî Local Nodes receive support *and* contribute back through knowledge, visibility, capital, or co-created tools.
- **Transparency and Accountability** - Regular reporting and open communication ensure we all learn and grow together.
- **Regenerative Leadership** - We embrace cycles of growth, composting, and renewal, allowing our network to evolve naturally.

### üß≠ Your Journey Ahead

The onboarding guide that follows outlines a clear pathway to establish your Local Node, from initial alignment to full activation. The process is designed to ensure you:

1. **Align with ReFi DAO‚Äôs shared mission and values,** as outlined in our [ReFi DAO Community Covenant V1](ReFi%20DAO%20Community%20Covenant%20V1%202072e7251f2f801bafbcc06b48debc70.md).
2. **Understand the commitments and benefits** detailed in the [**ReFi DAO Local Node Membership Agreement v1**](ReFi%20DAO%20Local%20Node%20Membership%20Agreement%20v1%202082e7251f2f8007985df4ee979dcc32.md) .
3. **Receive initial funding and support** through our decentralized funding mechanisms.
4. **Gain visibility, support, and collaboration** across the global ReFi ecosystem

This guide will walk you through each phase of onboarding ‚Äî from joining the network and submitting a proposal, to launching your node and integrating with peers around the world. Remember, you're not alone in this journey ‚Äî the ReFi DAO network is here to support you in building a thriving regenerative economy in your bioregion.
