# ReFi DAO Local Node Membership Agreement v1

## **1. Purpose & Scope**

This agreement establishes the terms of membership for being an officially recognized ReFi Local Node as part of the ReFi DAO global network. By signing this agreement onchain, the signer affirms their role as a Local Node Leader for a specific region or locality, and enters into this commitment on behalf of the Local Node they are representing. 

- **This agreement serves to:**
    - **Formally recognize the Local Node represented by the signer** as an official member of the ReFi DAO Network, affirming its alignment with ReFi DAO’s mission and vision (as outlined in the [Community Covenant](https://claim.hatsprotocol.xyz/42220/13.3.1)).
    - **Affirm alignment with ReFi DAO’s shared values and principles**, as outlined in the [ReFi DAO Community Covenant](https://claim.hatsprotocol.xyz/42220/13.3.1), which guide the ethical and cultural foundations of our global network;
    - **Establish the responsibilities and entitlements** of membership, including access to ReFi DAO resources, brand assets, coordination infrastructure, funding pathways, and peer collaboration;
    - **Enable transparent coordination and accountability**, while maintaining the sovereignty and contextual integrity of each Local Node.

This agreement is a decentralized governance commitment and does not create a legal partnership, employment relationship, or joint venture. Rather, it provides a mutually agreed framework for collaboration, support, and alignment between ReFi DAO Global and ReFi Local Nodes.

The signer acknowledges that future updates to the legal custodianship of ReFi DAO’s brand or coordination infrastructure — such as stewardship by a foundation or nonprofit entity — may lead to reasonable amendments of this agreement, as outlined in Section 9.

- **By signing this onchain agreement on behalf of their local node, the Local Node Leader:**
    - Attests to their legitimate representation of the local node
    - Confirms their intent to uphold the responsibilities of official membership;
    - Commits to actively contribute to the shared mission and vision of the ReFi DAO network, in collaboration with peers around the world;
    - **And affirms recognition and agreement with each of the articles detailed in this Membership Agreement**, as the basis for ongoing participation and mutual accountability within the network.

## **2. Definitions**

- For the purposes of this agreement, the following terms are defined as follows:
    - **ReFi Local Node**: A place-based community committed to the collective vision and mission of ReFi DAO (as outlined in the [Community Covenant](https://claim.hatsprotocol.xyz/42220/13.3.1)). Local Nodes operate with regional autonomy while adhering to the shared principles, values, and governance of ReFi DAO Global.
    - **ReFi DAO Global**: The coordinating body of the ReFi DAO network responsible for stewarding the global mission, providing resources and infrastructure, facilitating network alignment, and supporting the growth and impact of Local Nodes and other initiatives.
    - **ReFi Foundation**: The current fiscal sponsor of ReFi DAO Global, serving as the legal and financial custodian for certain activities, including grant disbursements, formal partnership agreements, and brand protection.
    - **ReFi Local Node Membership**: The official recognition of a Local Node within the ReFi DAO network, granting access to resources, brand assets, support systems, and participation in governance processes, in exchange for adherence to the responsibilities, values, and terms outlined in this agreement.
    - **ReFi DAO Brand Assets**: The intellectual property associated with ReFi DAO, including its name, logo, graphic templates, toolkits, event materials, documentation, and digital assets made available through the Local Node Toolkit or related ReFi DAO resources. Use of brand assets is subject to the licensing terms outlined in Section 7.
    - **Active Node**
        
        A Local Node that demonstrates ongoing active communications and demonstrated engagement through event hosting, content publishing, community coordination, or impact reporting—typically evidenced by updates submitted via Karma GAP or equivalent reporting channels.
        
    - **Network Reciprocity**
        
        The mutual flow of value, knowledge, visibility, and support between ReFi DAO Global, Local Nodes, and the broader network. Reciprocity may include voluntary revenue sharing, co-creation of public goods, knowledge exchange, mentorship, or platform promotion.
        

## **3. Membership Benefits**

Provided the terms and responsibilities of membership are upheld, official ReFi DAO Local Nodes are eligible for the following benefits:

### **3.1 Use of ReFi DAO Brand Assets**

The Local Node receives a **revocable, non-exclusive license** to use ReFi DAO brand assets, including the official name, logo, design templates, toolkits, and event materials. This license enables Local Nodes to visually align with the global network while retaining their local identity. Use of these assets should follow the guidelines outlined in the Local Node Toolkit and Brand Guidelines (see Section 7).

### **3.2 Official Listing & Recognition**

The Local Node will be **listed and promoted as an official member** of the ReFi DAO Network across:

- The ReFi DAO website’s Local Node Directory
- ReFi DAO’s social media and public communications (where appropriate)
- Network-aligned platforms such as [Karma GAP](https://karmagap.org/) and other emerging ReFi DAO partner ecosystems

This recognition amplifies the Local Node’s visibility and validates its alignment with the regenerative movement.

### **3.3 Community Access & Coordination Channels**

Local Node Leaders receive **access to private, gated coordination spaces**, like the The Local Node Leaders Telegram channel in addition to other spaces such as contributor forums or discussion platforms and bi-monthly coordination calls, working groups, and ecosystem alignment events. These channels foster peer-to-peer exchange, mutual support, and collaborative problem-solving across the network.

### **3.4 Access to Toolkits, Guides & Resources**

Official members receive **full access** to:

- The **Local Node Toolkit** — a comprehensive collection of operational templates, playbooks, and best practices for running successful local nodes.
- The **Local ReFi Toolkit** — curated materials for onboarding communities into regenerative finance, including business models, activities, and onboarding flows.
- Additional **advanced guides and resources**, including impact tracking templates, partnership building guides, and case studies from successful nodes.

These resources are designed to empower Local Node Leaders with the tools and knowledge to lead with confidence and competence.

### **3.5 Funding & Grant Opportunities**

Official Local Nodes will be **eligible for consideration** in:

- ReFi DAO-operated grant and funding rounds (e.g. Regen Coordiantion Global)

### **3.6 Participation in Governance & Reputation-Based Rewards**

Local Node Leaders who actively contribute to the ReFi DAO network will progressively **earn reputation and recognition** through ongoing participation, verified contributions, and transparent reporting.

Over time, this reputation may unlock:

- **Increased governance power** within ReFi DAO (e.g. voting weight in funding rounds, proposals, or network-wide decisions);
- **Delegate eligibility** for leadership or advisory roles across the ReFi ecosystem;
- **Participation in reputation-based governance pilots** (e.g. with Karma GAP, DeepGov, Hats Protocol, or other ReFi-aligned platforms);
- **Increased eligibility for airdrops, incentives, or exclusive campaigns** tied to ReFi DAO’s Prosperity Pass badge and related initiatives;
- **Access to gated opportunities**, such as paid contributor roles, protocol co-creation sprints, or delegate funding pools.

This system aims to reward **long-term engagement, transparency, and alignment**, and is designed to empower Local Node Leaders to shape the future of the regenerative finance movement—locally and globally.

### **3.7 Additional Support from ReFi DAO Global**

ReFi DAO Global may provide **customized support**, depending on the Local Node’s maturity and needs. This includes:

- **Mentorship** from experienced contributors and aligned partners

## **4. Node Commitments & Responsibilities**

As an Official ReFi DAO Local Node, the signer commits to upholding the following responsibilities, which ensure alignment, accountability, and mutual benefit within the global network.

### **4.1 Required Commitments**

The following commitments are foundational to continued recognition as a ReFi DAO Local Node:

- **Uphold ethical standards and cultural norms** as outlined in the [ReFi DAO Community Covenant](https://claim.hatsprotocol.xyz/42220/13.3.1), including a commitment to regeneration, inclusion, transparency, and respectful collaboration.
- **Use the ReFi DAO brand responsibly and in accordance with published Brand Guidelines**, as provided in the Local Node Toolkit. This includes using the logo, name, and related assets in a way that reflects positively on the network.
- **Avoid public misrepresentation** of ReFi DAO’s mission, intentions, or relationships. Local Nodes are encouraged to speak in their own voice and context, while clearly distinguishing their local initiatives from official global coordination efforts when appropriate.
- **Maintain active visibility through regular updates** submitted via [Karma GAP](https://karmagap.org/) or another approved coordination platform. These updates should reflect key activities, impact, and community engagement.
    
    > If no meaningful update is submitted within a 12-month period, the Local Node may be marked as inactive and subject to review or termination (see Section 8).
    > 

### **4.2 Encouraged Best Practices**

The following practices are not mandatory but are strongly encouraged to maximize the value of membership and foster community growth:

- **Participate in ReFi DAO strategy calls, coordination forums, and working groups**, especially when network-wide decisions, grant rounds, or governance pilots are underway. Regular participation helps strengthen alignment and co-create shared infrastructure.
- **Engage in knowledge sharing and storytelling**, including blog posts, local media, or short reports that highlight key learnings and regenerative outcomes from your region.
- **Collaborate with other Local Nodes** on cross-regional campaigns, ecosystem partnerships, or funding proposals, using the shared tools and communication channels provided.
- **Contribute feedback to the evolution of ReFi DAO tooling and governance**, including pilots like Karma GAP, the Prosperity Passport, and funding coordination experiments.

## **5. Reciprocal Contributions & Value Sharing**

ReFi DAO aims to embody principles of **mutual support, transparency, and regenerative economics**. As such, we invite all Local Nodes to engage in a spirit of **reciprocal contribution**, recognizing that a strong, resourced ReFi DAO Global benefits the entire network — and vice versa.

This section outlines **voluntary and suggested practices** for contributing back to the network in a way that is **symbiotic, transparent, and aligned with each Local Node’s capacity and success**.

### **5.1 Mutual Reciprocity in a Regenerative Network**

We aim to co-create a global system where:

- **Value flows in all directions** — not only from global to local, but also from successful Local Nodes back into shared infrastructure;
- Nodes **support each other financially and operationally**, wherever possible exchanging goods, services, knowledge, and capital within the network;
- We collectively **grow the Total Value Flowed (TVF)** across the ReFi DAO Network and global ReFi ecosystem — strengthening local economies while deepening global cooperation.

We ask Local Nodes to consider what they can **contribute back to ReFi DAO Global**, whether through financial contributions, in-kind services, tools, templates, impact data, mentorship, or ecosystem support.

### **5.2 Suggested Revenue Sharing for Grant Funding**

For **grants received independently** (outside of ReFi DAO-operated or Regen Coordination-led rounds), we suggest a **voluntary contribution of ~10%** of the total grant amount, especially where:

- The ReFi DAO brand, frameworks, or methodologies were used in the application;
- Grant-writing or visibility was supported by ReFi DAO Global or the wider network.

This contribution is not mandatory, but **strongly encouraged** for nodes receiving significant funding as a result of their affiliation with the ReFi DAO brand, resources, or ecosystem relationships.

### **5.3 Revenue Sharing for Branded ReFi Models**

Some Local Nodes may choose to implement **business models under the ReFi DAO brand** (e.g., consulting, education programs, toolkits, or technology deployments). In such cases, revenue sharing structures may be co-designed with ReFi DAO Global on a **case-by-case basis**, with considerations for:

- Alignment with shared values and long-term mission
- Use of co-developed brand assets or tools
- Support received from ReFi DAO Global
- Long-term sustainability of both local and global entities

These arrangements are meant to foster **win-win outcomes**, not extractive relationships.

### **5.4 Accountability & Governance of Contributions**

All funds contributed by Local Nodes to ReFi DAO Global will be:

- **Fully transparent and traceable**, with reporting on how funds are allocated and which initiatives they support;
- **Delegated to community-governed systems**, such as [ReFi DAO’s Gardens.xyz](https://gardens.xyz/) or other collective funding platforms;
- **Influenced by Local Node Leaders**, who may participate in **budgeting, proposal voting, and strategic decisions** regarding the use of shared resources.

This ensures that Local Nodes not only **support the network**, but also **shape it**, helping to allocate resources in line with the values, needs, and opportunities emerging across the ecosystem.

## **6. Brand License, Governance & Intellectual Property**

### **6.1 Brand License & Usage Rights**

Upon signing this agreement, the Local Node receives a **revocable, non-exclusive license** to use the ReFi DAO brand and associated intellectual property for the duration of its active membership.

This includes use of:

- The ReFi Local Node name, logo and other key brand graphic assets
- Design templates, event graphics, and promotional materials
- Toolkits, presentations, and other shared assets provided by ReFi DAO Global

Use of these brand assets must:

- Follow the **ReFi DAO Brand Guidelines** as provided in the Local Node Toolkit
- Reflect alignment with the mission, values, and public image of ReFi DAO
- Clearly distinguish between local activities and official communications from ReFi DAO Global (when appropriate)

Any misuse, distortion, or misrepresentation of the ReFi DAO brand may result in **suspension or termination** of membership and revocation of brand usage rights (see Section 9).

### **6.2 Open Source & Public Goods Ethos**

ReFi DAO is committed to the **creation of open-source tools, knowledge, and templates**. Local Nodes are encouraged to:

- Contribute new designs, materials, or localized versions of ReFi DAO assets back to the commons
- Share improvements or customizations in a way that supports other nodes and global innovation
- License co-created public goods under Creative Commons or similarly open terms, where possible

This practice fosters **collective intelligence** and accelerates the movement’s impact globally.

### **6.3 Brand Governance & IP Stewardship**

At present, ReFi DAO brand assets are **stewarded by ReFi DAO Global** on behalf of the network, with operational support from its fiscal sponsor, **ReFi Foundation**.

ReFi DAO Global retains the right to:

- Define appropriate brand usage through updated guidelines
- Approve or revoke use in cases of misalignment, harm, or inactivity
- Co-design custom brand extensions or licensing agreements with Local Nodes pursuing high-profile projects or business models

### **6.4 Future IP Formalization & Continuity**

ReFi DAO is in the process of formalizing **legal custodianship of its brand, trademarks, and digital assets** under a community-aligned legal entity (e.g., ReFi Foundation or Regen Commons).

Upon formalization:

- This agreement will be **updated or supplemented** to reflect the new legal structure
- All reasonable efforts will be made to ensure **continuity and fairness**, respecting the rights and responsibilities already granted to Local Nodes
- Any material changes will be shared transparently with Local Nodes in advance

Until then, this agreement serves as a **good-faith brand license** under ReFi DAO’s decentralized governance framework.

### **6.5 Network Initiatives & Brand Extension Proposals**

Local Node Leaders and other aligned contributors are encouraged to propose **Network Initiatives** that expand the impact of the ReFi DAO brand—such as new media projects, research labs, tooling ventures, or coordination platforms.

To request use of the brand for a new initiative, contributors can:

- Submit a proposal to the **🛠️ ReFi DAO Network Initiatives Pool** on [gardens.fund](https://app.gardens.fund/gardens/42220/0x4f604735c1cf31399c6e711d5962b2b3e0225ad3/0x13e71c56c5b048e9b8b6a9dbb4a4f346b5dab986/49)
- Outline the vision, alignment with the ReFi DAO mission, value to the network, and proposed use of brand assets
- Request feedback and support from the ReFi DAO community through Telegram, discourse, or other governance channels

## **7. Term, Composting & Renewal**

This agreement shall remain in effect **until voluntarily ended or composted**, as described below. Membership is ongoing by default, but subject to an **annual review cycle** to support alignment, vitality, and mutual reciprocity across the network.

### **7.1 Annual Review & Activity Check**

Each Local Node will be **reviewed annually** to assess:

- Network participation and communication
- Submission of updates via Karma GAP or equivalent platform
- Impact claims, community engagement, or other contributions

Local Nodes that show **no meaningful activity or fail to respond over a 12-month period** may be marked as **inactive**. In these cases, ReFi DAO Global may initiate a process of **membership composting** — a soft and respectful winding-down of official recognition, brand access, and community privileges.

> Just like the natural cycles in nature, this yearly process enables recycling, composting, and renewal, creating space for future growth and generative possibilities.
> 

### **7.2 Composting & Winding Down**

If a Local Node enters a composting process, it will:

- Be notified of the status and given an opportunity to **respond or re-engage**
- Have its **access to brand assets and certain platforms paused or revoked**, unless otherwise agreed
- Be **removed from public listings** as an active ReFi DAO Local Node

Once composted, the region may be opened for:

- **A renewal proposal** by former node leaders
- **A new proposal** from other local leaders wishing to form a Local Node in that geography
- Review and support from ReFi DAO Global to ensure brand alignment and community continuity

This helps prevent **brand stagnation or squatting**, while enabling the local energy to cycle and return in a new form.

### **7.3 Voluntary Withdrawal**

A Local Node Leader may choose to **voluntarily end** their membership at any time by submitting a short notice to ReFi DAO Global. In such cases, the Local Node will:

- Undergo a soft wind-down of coordination access and brand usage
- Be invited to submit a final reflection or impact update (optional, but encouraged)
- Remain welcome as an alumnus in the broader ReFi DAO community

### **7.4 Revocation for Misalignment or Harm**

In rare but serious cases, ReFi DAO Global reserves the right to **immediately revoke** a Local Node’s membership, brand license, and network access if the node:

- Engages in clear **misuse of the ReFi DAO brand** or misrepresentation of the network
- Violates the [ReFi DAO Community Covenant](https://claim.hatsprotocol.xyz/42220/13.3.1) or acts in a manner that causes harm to individuals, communities, or the ecosystem
- Commits fraud, misuses funds, or breaches basic ethical standards

Such action is considered a last resort. **Whenever possible, ReFi DAO Global will first seek resolution through the mechanisms outlined in Section 10: Dispute Resolution**. This ensures that concerns are addressed fairly, transparently, and in alignment with the network’s regenerative principles.

> The intention of revocation is not to protect the integrity and well-being of the broader network — while honoring the possibility for learning, repair, and eventual re-engagement where appropriate.
> 

### **7.5 Renewal & Regeneration**

Composted or expired nodes are **not permanently closed**. Former or new leaders are welcome to **submit a fresh proposal** for recognition through the standard onboarding process.

> Through cycles of composting and renewal, ReFi DAO fosters a living ecosystem of local nodes — rooted in integrity, constantly evolving, and always open to new seeds of regeneration.
> 

## **8. Dispute Resolution**

ReFi DAO is committed to fostering a **collaborative, respectful, and regenerative culture**, even in moments of disagreement or misalignment. This section outlines the steps available to resolve conflicts between Local Nodes and ReFi DAO Global in a way that upholds fairness, dignity, and the integrity of the network.

### **10.1 Principles of Conflict Resolution**

Disputes are an opportunity for learning, reflection, and mutual understanding. ReFi DAO encourages open communication, context-sensitive solutions, and shared understanding over punitive or hierarchical responses.

### **10.2 Resolution Pathways**

Disputes or concerns — whether operational, ethical, or interpersonal — will follow a tiered resolution process:

1. **Informal Dialogue**
    
    The involved parties are encouraged to engage in **direct, respectful communication** to clarify misunderstandings and explore mutually agreeable solutions.
    
2. **Mediation**
    
    If informal resolution is unsuccessful, either party may request **neutral mediation** facilitated by a trusted ReFi DAO steward, contributor, or aligned community mediator. The aim is to restore clarity, trust, and alignment.
    
3. **Community Review**
    
    Where necessary, the matter may be brought to the **broader ReFi DAO community** via appropriate coordination platforms (e.g. Charmverse, governance forums, gated communication channels). Community members may offer insight, support, or propose restorative responses.
    
4. **Final Actions**
    
    In cases where misalignment or harm persists after good-faith attempts at resolution, formal actions such as **membership composting**, **brand license revocation**, or **suspension from ReFi DAO platforms** may be taken in alignment with Section 9.
    

### **10.3 Transparency & Confidentiality**

While the **process of resolution** may be documented to ensure transparency, personal details and sensitive information will be handled with care and **kept confidential unless otherwise agreed** by the involved parties.

### **10.4 Right to Appeal & Review**

Any decision made by ReFi DAO Global regarding revocation, mediation outcome, or other corrective action may be **formally appealed** by the Local Node through a written request. ReFi DAO commits to reviewing such appeals in good faith and, where appropriate, to including peer voices in the reconsideration process.

> Our ability to navigate conflict with care, courage, and curiosity is core to our shared mission and community integrity.
> 

## **9. Evolution of This Agreement**

This Membership Agreement is a **living document**, designed to evolve as ReFi DAO’s ecosystem matures. Amendments may be proposed by ReFi DAO Global or the Local Node community, and will be made transparently, with fair notice and in alignment with the spirit of collaboration.

Local Nodes will be informed of any proposed changes, and where material adjustments are required (e.g., changes to brand governance, IP custodianship, or funding flows), updated terms will be presented for re-signing or co-approval.

## **10. Acknowledgement & Onchain Signature**

By signing this agreement onchain, the Local Node Leader affirms that they:

- Have read and understood the terms outlined in this Membership Agreement;
- Acknowledge alignment with the [ReFi DAO Charter](https://www.notion.so/201bf304370a8038a898e7ba76319fc1?pvs=21) and [Community Covenant](https://claim.hatsprotocol.xyz/42220/13.3.1);
- Intend to uphold the responsibilities, ethical standards, and coordination commitments of an Official ReFi DAO Local Node;
- Agree to the shared principles of mutual reciprocity, brand stewardship, and regenerative network participation;
- Recognize that this agreement is part of a broader and evolving ecosystem of tools, relationships, and governance frameworks.

This onchain signature serves as a public affirmation of intent and accountability, recorded transparently and verifiably on the blockchain. Should the Local Node wish to end its membership or update its terms, it may do so through the review and composting mechanisms outlined in Section 9.
