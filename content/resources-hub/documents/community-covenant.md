# **3. Network Structure**

ReFi DAO operates as a decentralized network of interconnected structures and initiatives, each playing a distinct role in advancing our shared mission and vision. The network structure aims to balance autonomy and collaboration, decentralization and alignment, enabling diverse contributions while ensuring cohesive progress toward the DAO‚Äôs collective goals. 

1. **ReFi DAO Global:** The connective coordination body for the global network, providing strategic development, operational support, and alignment across the ecosystem. **Core Stewards**, the **Source Lead**, and **Contributors & Advisors** collaborate to nurture the network‚Äôs growth, steward financial and operational resources, and ensure alignment with ReFi DAO‚Äôs mission and vision.
2. **Local Nodes:** Autonomous and self-governing, Local Nodes are place-based communities that explore, implement, and innovate regenerative finance solutions within their regional contexts. While operating independently, they align with ReFi DAO‚Äôs broader mission, values, and charter and participate in the global network by fostering collaboration, sharing knowledge, and reporting transparently on their progress and impact.
3. **Network Initiatives:** Independent projects, working groups, or guilds that bring specialized focus and innovation to the DAO‚Äôs mission. Examples include the **ReFi Podcast** and **Prosperity Passport**. While autonomous, Network Initiatives maintain coherence with the broader network, contribute unique value, and align with shared principles.
4. **Network Members:** Entry-level members who join ReFi DAO by signing this covenant, signaling their alignment with its mission, vision, and values. Members engage informally by participating in discussions, staying informed, and providing feedback. They may also support the DAO‚Äôs sustainability through contributions such as donations or voluntary efforts, with the opportunity to take on more active roles as they deepen their involvement.

Together, these interconnected structures form the foundation of ReFi DAO, fostering a dynamic, collaborative ecosystem designed to drive change on both local and global scales. Every member, initiative, and local node has a role to play in co-creating a regenerative future.

# 4. Governance Fundamentals

ReFi DAO‚Äôs governance model aims to balance inclusivity, transparency, and accountability with effectiveness and adaptability. Rooted in principles of decentralization and regenerative practices, it aims to empower all members while maintaining clear structures to support alignment and coordinated action.

### **Key principles:**

- **Decentralized Autonomy with Collaborative Alignment:** Local Nodes and Network Initiatives retain sovereignty to self-govern based on local contexts, while at the same time maintaining collaborative alignment with ReFi DAO‚Äôs global mission, values, and community covenants.

- **Adaptability, Evolution & Continuous Improvement:** The governance model evolves with the DAO, responding to feedback and changes in the ecosystem. Regular reporting, transparent financial practices, and open communication ensure alignment with the mission. Information on past actions, operations, and future plans are openly accessible to members. Defined processes for raising ideas, proposing initiatives, and holding leadership accountable are integral.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Disputes are resolved constructively through collaborative mediation and clear escalation pathways to maintain a positive and inclusive community environment.

ReFi DAO‚Äôs governance framework is an evolving system, designed to grow alongside the community it serves.
