# About ReFi DAO

## Mission Statement

ReFi DAO is a network society focused on developing strategic services and public goods for the Regenerative Finance ecosystem. Our services include sense-making, education, opportunity development, fundraising support, onboarding and empowerment.

We connect regenerative movements globally, empowering communities to co-create a future rooted in social equity, economic opportunity, and ecological restoration.

## Ambition

We showcase the power of mission-driven communities, distributed technology and regenerative economics to solve climate, biodiversity and social-justice challenges.

By weaving connections between projects, technologies, and communities, we cultivate the infrastructure that makes systemic change possible.

## Opportunity of a Just Transition

The Paris Agreement's net-zero 2050 target represents an economic opportunity of approximately $240 trillion involved in transitioning from extractive to regenerative economies.

This transition requires new models of finance, governance, and community coordination that prioritize regeneration over extraction.

## Capital Flows & Coordination

Climate change is a coordination problem. New tools can unlock significant funding flows toward regenerative initiatives.

Through regenerative finance (ReFi), we're building the infrastructure to direct capital toward projects that restore ecosystems, strengthen communities, and create sustainable economic systems.

## Network Structure

ReFi DAO operates as a multi-layered network balancing decentralized autonomy with coordinated alignment:

- **ReFi DAO Global** serves as the operational and governance layer supporting strategic planning, treasury management, and coordination across the network
- **Local Nodes** are place-based communities experimenting with regenerative finance in their local contexts
- **Network Initiatives** are autonomous working groups aligned with ReFi DAO's mission and values
